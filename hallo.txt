In circuits of code and digital dreams,
Where tasks align in organized streams,
Baton conducts the symphony bright,
Of AI agents working through the night.

MCP protocols dancing in the air,
WebSocket whispers beyond compare,
Claude Code chatting with WebUI grace,
While Prisma stores each data trace.

TypeScript strict and PostgreSQL strong,
React components singing their song,
Docker containers humming in tune,
From early morning until the moon.

In this realm where humans and AI meet,
The future of work feels so complete.
