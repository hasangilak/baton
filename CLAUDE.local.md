## Tools and Workflows
- Added grep and context7 mcp for code snippets and documentation for SSE servers
- Reminder: continue exploring and think deeply about implementation challenges

## Development Practices
- Never run backend npm scripts. We have docker compose for it. If you want to check APIs, spin the docker up if it's down or stopped


- only commit and push when i tell you
