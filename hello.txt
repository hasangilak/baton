Beneath Berlin's sky so wide,
Hassan walks with quiet pride.
Blue as oceans, deep and true,
His favorite hue in morning dew.

From German streets to code's embrace,
Building Baton, line by space.
Tasks and todos, neatly arranged,
A digital world, beautifully changed.

In Docker containers, services rise,
WebSockets connect beneath the skies.
MCP servers hum their song,
As Claude and Baton dance along.

From Berlin's heart to pixels bright,
A coder's journey, day and night.
Where blue dreams meet the screen's soft glow,
And projects flourish, row by row.
